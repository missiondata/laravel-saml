# Fork Notes

This is a fork (like many others) to use this saml package with newer versions of Laraval. It also will upgrade other dependencies (like lightsaml) so that it continues to be useable.

# ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) IMPORTANT NOTE : LOOKING FOR OWNER

 __No more active development: As I am currently not able to keep on developing this repository and there are many forks and PRs, I would be very glad to transfer the repository to someone else. Please let me know by writing me an email to <git@kingstarter.de>.__

# Laravel SAML

Laravel-SAML implements a SAML2 IDP plugin to transform laravel into a SAML identity provider (IDP) beside the regular authentication. The package is designed to work with Laravel 5.4 or above.

The package is based on [Dustin Parham's guide to implement a SAML IDP with laravel](https://imbringingsyntaxback.com/implementing-a-saml-idp-with-laravel/). To get a better basic understanding for SAML in general, read [Cheung's SAML for Web Developers](https://github.com/jch/saml).

## Installation

### Basic package installation

Using ```composer```: 

``` 
composer require "kingstarter/laravel-saml":"dev-master"
```

#### Lightsaml dependency problem

In case you run in a current lightsaml dependency problem regarding symfony 4 (event dispatcher) you might consider [using a fork of lightsaml allowing to use symfony 4](https://github.com/kingstarter/laravel-saml/issues/8#issuecomment-366991715).

#### Laravel 5.4
Add the service provider to ```config/app.php```

```
    KingStarter\LaravelSaml\LaravelSamlServiceProvider::class,
```
#### Laravel 5.5+
This package supports Laravel's Package Auto Discovery and should be automatically loaded when required using composer. If the package is not auto discovered run

```bash
    php artisan package:discover
```
#### Configuration
There is one configuration file to publish and the config/filesystem.php file that needs to be extended. The command
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="saml_config"
```

will publish the config/saml.php file. 

#### SAML SP entries

Within the saml.php config file the SAML Service Provider array needs to be filled. Subsequently an example from the config/saml.php file:

```
'sp' => [        
    
    /**
     * Sample SP entry
     * The entry is identified by the base64 encoded URL. This example shows a possible entry for
     * a SimpleSamlPhp service provider running on localhost:
     * 
     * Sample URL:         https://localhost/samlsp/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/default-sp
     * Base64 encoded URL: aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3Qvc2FtbHNwL21vZHVsZS5waHAvc2FtbC9zcC9zYW1sMi1hY3MucGhwL2RlZmF1bHQtc3A=
     */
    'aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3Qvc2FtbHNwL21vZHVsZS5waHAvc2FtbC9zcC9zYW1sMi1hY3MucGhwL2RlZmF1bHQtc3A=' => [
    
        // The destination is the consuming SAML URL. This might be a SamlAuthController receiving the SAML response.  
        'destination' => 'https://localhost/samlsp/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/default-sp',
        
        // Issuer could be anything, mostly it makes sense to pass the metadata URL
        // This is the IDP Entity ID that will be sent to the SP.
        'issuer' => 'https://localhost',
        
        // OPTIONAL: Use a specific audience restriction value when creating the SAMLRequest object.
        //           Default value is the assertion consumer service URL (the base64 encoded SP url). 
        //           This is a bugfix for Nextcloud as SP and can be removed for normal SPs.
        'audience_restriction' => 'http://localhost',

        // OPTIONAL: Use to override the default email attribute to set a custom NameID value for a SP
        //           The NameID attribute must be a property on the User model.
        'nameID' => 'username',
    ],
    
],
```

You can generate the base_64 encoded AssertionURL by using the following artisan command.
 
```bash
   $ php artisan laravel-saml:encodeurl https://sp.webapp.com/saml/login
   --
   URL Given: https://sp.webapp.com/saml/login
   Encoded AssertionURL:aHR0cHM6Ly9zcC53ZWJhcHAuY29tL3NhbWwvbG9naW4=
```

config/saml.php:
```
'sp' => [        
    
     ...

    /**
     * New entry
     * 
     * Sample URL:         https://sp.webapp.com/saml/login
     * Base64 encoded URL: aHR0cHM6Ly9zcC53ZWJhcHAuY29tL3NhbWwvY29uc3VtZQ==
     */
    'aHR0cHM6Ly9zcC53ZWJhcHAuY29tL3NhbWwvY29uc3VtZQ==' => [
        'destination' => 'https://sp.webapp.com/saml/consume',
        'issuer'      => 'https://sp.webapp.com',
    ],
],
```

#### FileSystem configuration 

Within ```config/filesystem.php``` following entry needs to be added:
```
    'disks' => [

        ...
        
        'saml' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'root' => storage_path().'/saml',
        ],

    ],
```

The package controllers are using the ```storage/saml``` path for retrieving both certificates and the metadata file. Create first the storage path, then either add or link the certificates. Add also a metadata file for the SAML IDP. For help generating an IDP metadata.xml file, see https://www.samltool.com/idp_metadata.php.

```
mkdir -p storage/saml/idp
touch storage/saml/idp/{metadata.xml,cert.pem,key.pem}
```

Add the contents to the metadata.xml, cert.pem and key.pem files for the IDP. 

### Using the SAML package

To use the SAML package, some files need to be modified. Within your login view, problably ```resources/views/auth/login.blade.php``` add a SAMLRequest field beneath the CSRF field (this is actually a good place for it):
```
    {{-- The hidden CSRF field for secure authentication --}}
    {{ csrf_field() }}
    {{-- Add a hidden SAML Request field for SAML authentication --}}
    @if(isset($_GET['SAMLRequest']))
        <input type="hidden" id="SAMLRequest" name="SAMLRequest" value="{{ $_GET['SAMLRequest'] }}">
    @endif
```

The SAMLRequest field will be filled automatically when a SAMLRequest is sent by a http request and therefore initiate a SAML authentication attempt. To initiate the SAML auth, the login and redirect functions need to be modified. Within ```app/Http/Middleware/AuthenticatesUsers.php``` add following lines to both the top and the authenticated function: 
(NOTE: you might need to copy it out from vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Auth/ to your Middleware directory) 

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\RedirectsUsers;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\ThrottlesLogins;

use KingStarter\LaravelSaml\Http\Traits\SamlAuth;

trait AuthenticatesUsers
{
    use RedirectsUsers, ThrottlesLogins, SamlAuth;
    
    ...

    protected function authenticated(Request $request, $user)
    {
        if(Auth::check() && isset($request['SAMLRequest'])) {
            $this->handleSamlLoginRequest($request);
        }
    }
    
    ...
```

To allow later direct redirection when somebody is already logged in, we need to add also some lines to ```app/Http/Middleware/RedirectIfAuthenticated.php```:
```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use KingStarter\LaravelSaml\Http\Traits\SamlAuth;

class RedirectIfAuthenticated
{
    use SamlAuth;
    
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Closure  $next
     * @param  string|null  $guard
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle($request, Closure $next, $guard = null)
    {
        if(Auth::check() && isset($request['SAMLRequest'])){  
            $this->handleSamlLoginRequest($request);
        }
        if (Auth::guard($guard)->check()) {
            return redirect('/home');
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

## SAML Service Providers (SPs)

To add one or more service providers, go to the ```config/saml.php``` configuration file and scroll down to the 'sp' array. Having the Login-Address of the SAML-SP, add another entry. For reasons of internal interpretation, the URL needs to be Base64 encoded. 

### Debugging SP entries

In case that there are some problems receiving the Base64 string or evaluating SAML authentication requests in general, it is possible to use the debugger setting ```saml.debug_saml_request``` within the config file. 

```
    // Allow debugging within SamlAuth trait to get SP data  
    // during SAML authentication request
    'debug_saml_request' => true,
```

Make sure that the environmental logging variable ```APP_LOG_LEVEL``` is set to debug within your ```.env``` file.
